If you want to use the scripts and configurations in this directory,
you probably want to add it to your ${PATH} variable so the 
scripts work.


DUMPING 802.11 FRAMES (dump.click)
=====================
You can run:
click dump.click
which will be like running tcpdump with prism headers.
The cool thing is that you can run this while still running other
click configurations (like access-point.click or station.click).
You can also change that file to filter out things (like beacons)
by editing dump.click


ASSOCIATING TO AN ACCESS POINT (station.click)
=============================
I do the following to associate with an access point:

click station.click > /tmp/station.log 2>&1 &
scan.pl
associate.pl

scan.pl will scan all the channels for access points. You can see them
by running

read_handler.pl bs.scan

associate.pl associates with access point with the highest RSSI.
If you run associate.pl "ssid", it will associate with that access 
point.

At this point, you can run dhclient or whatever on the "station"
interface.


RUNNING AN ACCESS POINT (access-point.click)
=======================




RUNNING ROOFNET (gen_config_roofnet.pl)
===============
Run the following sequence of commands:
~/co/click/conf/wifi/gen_config_roofnet.pl > /tmp/roofnet.click
/jbicket/click/userlevel/click /tmp/roofnet.click > /tmp/roofnet.log 2>&1 &
sleep 1
route add default srcr

and this will create a srcr interface that will be the default route.

You can use the read_handler.pl to see what's going on:
"read_handler.pl srcr/es.bcast_stats" shows me the following:

5.33.224.200 00:02:6f:21:e0:c8 [ 2 60 70 100 ] [ 2 1500 80 100 ] [ 4
1500 80 100 ] [ 11 1500 70 100 ] [ 12 60 70 100 ] [ 12 1500 70 100 ] [
18 1500 80 100 ] [ 22 1500 80 100 ] [ 24 1500 80 100 ] [ 36 1500 80 100
] [ 48 1500 80 50 ] seq 328095612 period 30000 tau 300000 sent 31
last_rx 1.498260

which shows the neighbors that you see as well as the precent of
broadcast probes you receive.  The format is:
ip mac [ bitrate*2 packet_size fwd_delivery_rate rev_delivery_rate]...

You can also run "read_handler.pl srcr/gw.gateway-stats" which shows
5.33.224.200 3.297344 1262

The format is: ip last_rx metric
