1)  RUNNING EXPERIMENTS

Run an experiment by running one of my scripts in the scripts directory. To
make your own experiment script, you must be sure to print a line such as the
following right before each invocation of router:

[CPU|GPU] <FEATURE BEING VARIED> <VALUE FOR THIS RUN>

For example, if the feature I'm testing is the effect of Batch Size, one
invocation of the GPU version of router with a batch size of 1024 would look
like this:

echo -e "\n\nGPU BATCH 1024"
$ROUTER_DIR/router -runtime=$RUNTIME -batch=1024


When you run the experiment, I suggest sending the output to a file so it can
be saved and used for generating plots later:

./batch_size.sh > ../data/batch_size.output



2) PLOTTING RESULTS

Switch to the plots directory. Generating a plot takes two steps: first, run
the prepare_data.py script to process a raw output file into a data file that
gnuplot can use. This script takes 2 arguments: 1) the name of the feature
being varied and 2) the path to the output file. For example:

python prepare_data.py BATCH ../data/batch_size.output

Now you can run the plot.sh script to actually generate plots. This script
takes 3 arguments: 1) The name of the independent variable, 2) the type of unit
in which the independent variable is measured, and 3) the path to the data
file. For example:

./plot.sh 'Batch Size' packets ../data/batch_size.data
