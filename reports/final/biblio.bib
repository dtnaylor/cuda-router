@article{mobilityFirst,
	Abstract = {The Internet is at a historic inflection point where mobile, wireless devices are becoming so dominant that core archi- tectural changes are necessary to efficiently support them. This paper presents the high-level concepts and design deci- sions used to realize the key routing component of the Mo- bilityFirst architecture, which is a clean-slate project being conducted as part of the NSF Future Internet Architecture program. In particular, we describe GSTAR, a mobility- centric generalized storage-aware routing approach based on the following key design principles: separation of names from addresses, late binding of routable addresses, in-network storage, and conditional routing decision space. TheGSTAR protocol described is based on hop-by-hop forwarding of large protocol data units (PDUs) between routers with stor- age. The packet header incorporates both name and address information enabling routers to execute a hybrid forwarding algorithmthat uses topological addresses when available and refers back to names (i.e. global identifiers) to deal with dy- namically changing points of attachment and disconnection. At a local level, GSTAR utilizes both fine-grain path quality information and DTN-style connectivity information to deal with the many challenges found in mobile environments.},

@article{Feamster2007,
	Abstract = {Today's Internet Service Providers (ISPs) serve two roles: managing their network infrastructure and providing (arguably limited) services to end users. We argue that coupling these roles impedes the deployment of new protocols and architectures, and that the future Internet should support two separate entities: infrastructure providers (who manage the physical infrastructure) and service providers (who deploy network protocols and offer end-to-end services). We present a high-level design for Cabo, an architecture that enables this separation; we also describe challenges associated with realizing this architecture.},
