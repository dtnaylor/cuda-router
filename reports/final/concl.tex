\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

Software routers are no doubt poised to start playing a larger and larger role
in real systems. The popularity of software defined networks like OpenFlow
alone is a big enough driver to ensure this, though software routers might
find other niches as well. To our knowledge, GPU-based software routers are
currently limited to the research lab, and we are unsure whether this is likely
to change. Our experience (and PacketShader's success) suggests that they might
be a viable option, though the effort required to optimize them may in the end
outweigh the benefits.
